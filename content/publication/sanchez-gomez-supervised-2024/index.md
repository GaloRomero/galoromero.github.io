abstract: 'Research on personal adornments depends on the reliable characterisation
  of materials to trace provenance and model complex social networks. However, many
  analytical techniques require the transfer of materials from the museum to the laboratory,
  involving high insurance costs and limiting the number of items that can be analysed,
  making the process of empirical data collection a complicated, expensive and time-consuming
  routine. In this study, we compiled the largest geochemical dataset of Iberian personal
  adornments ( n = 1243 samples) by coupling X-ray fluorescence compositional data
  with their respective X-ray diffraction mineral labels. This allowed us to develop
  a machine learning-based framework for the prediction of bead-forming minerals by
  training and benchmarking 13 of the most widely used supervised algorithms. As a
  proof of concept, we developed a multiclass model and evaluated its performance
  on two assemblages from different Portuguese sites with current mineralogical characterisation:
  Cova das Lapas ( n = 15 samples) and Gruta da Marmota ( n = 10 samples). Our results
  showed that decisión-tres based classifiers outperformed other classification logics
  given the discriminative importance of some chemical elements in determining the
  mineral phase, which fits particularly well with the decision-making process of
  this type of model. The comparison of results between the different validation sets
  and the proof-of-concept has highlighted the risk of using synthetic data to handle
  imbalance and the main limitation of the framework: its restrictive class system.
  We conclude that the presented approach can successfully assist in the mineral classification
  workflow when specific analyses are not available, saving time and allowing a transparent
  and straightforward assessment of model predictions. Furthermore, we propose a workflow
  for the interpretation of predictions using the model outputs as compound responses
  enabling an uncertainty reduction approach currently used by our team. The Python-based
  framework is packaged in a public repository and includes all the necessary resources
  for its reusability without the need for any installation.'
