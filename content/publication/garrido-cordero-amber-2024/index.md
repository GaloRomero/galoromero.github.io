abstract: In recent years, significant advancements have occurred in our comprehension
  of amber consumption patterns in the Iberian Peninsula. This progress stems from
  the increasing volume of FTIR data related to both archaeological and geological
  amber. Consequently, a chronological model has been established, delineating amber
  consump­ tion in the Iberian Peninsula from the Late Paleolithic to the Iron Age.
  Broadly, local amber consumption has been minimal since the Paleolithic period.
  Sicilian amber makes its appearance in Iberia around the 5th mil­ lennium BCE and
  fades away in the 2nd millennium BCE, giving way to Baltic amber, which has remained
  the sole source since then.
