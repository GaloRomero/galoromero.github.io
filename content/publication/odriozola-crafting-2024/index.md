abstract: The discovery of a set of beads, comprising both Sicilian amber and resin-coated
  beads in the Middle Bronze Age burial site of Cova del Gegant (Sitges, Barcelona,
  Spain), has sparked inquiries into whether the coating was intended for imitation
  or counterfeiting of amber. We assert that human-made materials, such as bead coatings,
  are intentionally conceived, designed, and crafted to fulfill specific functions.
  Thus, for an object to effectively fulfill its intended purpose, it must meet particular
  performance criteria influenced by situational factors.
