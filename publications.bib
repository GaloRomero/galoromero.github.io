	abstract = {In recent years, significant advancements have occurred in our comprehension of amber consumption patterns in the Iberian Peninsula. This progress stems from the increasing volume of FTIR data related to both archaeological and geological amber. Consequently, a chronological model has been established, delineating amber consump­ tion in the Iberian Peninsula from the Late Paleolithic to the Iron Age. Broadly, local amber consumption has been minimal since the Paleolithic period. Sicilian amber makes its appearance in Iberia around the 5th mil­ lennium BCE and fades away in the 2nd millennium BCE, giving way to Baltic amber, which has remained the sole source since then.},

We assert that human-made materials, such as bead coatings, are intentionally conceived, designed, and crafted to fulfill specific functions. Thus, for an object to effectively fulfill its intended purpose, it must meet particular performance criteria influenced by situational factors.},

	abstract = {Research on personal adornments depends on the reliable characterisation of materials to trace provenance and model complex social networks. However, many analytical techniques require the transfer of materials from the museum to the laboratory, involving high insurance costs and limiting the number of items that can be analysed, making the process of empirical data collection a complicated, expensive and time-consuming routine. In this study, we compiled the largest geochemical dataset of Iberian personal adornments (
              n
              = 1243 samples) by coupling X-ray fluorescence compositional data with their respective X-ray diffraction mineral labels. This allowed us to develop a machine learning-based framework for the prediction of bead-forming minerals by training and benchmarking 13 of the most widely used supervised algorithms. As a proof of concept, we developed a multiclass model and evaluated its performance on two assemblages from different Portuguese sites with current mineralogical characterisation: Cova das Lapas (
              n
              = 15 samples) and Gruta da Marmota (
              n
              = 10 samples). Our results showed that decisión-tres based classifiers outperformed other classification logics given the discriminative importance of some chemical elements in determining the mineral phase, which fits particularly well with the decision-making process of this type of model. The comparison of results between the different validation sets and the proof-of-concept has highlighted the risk of using synthetic data to handle imbalance and the main limitation of the framework: its restrictive class system. We conclude that the presented approach can successfully assist in the mineral classification workflow when specific analyses are not available, saving time and allowing a transparent and straightforward assessment of model predictions. Furthermore, we propose a workflow for the interpretation of predictions using the model outputs as compound responses enabling an uncertainty reduction approach currently used by our team. The Python-based framework is packaged in a public repository and includes all the necessary resources for its reusability without the need for any installation.},
