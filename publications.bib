  abstract = {Research on personal adornments depends on the reliable characterisation of materials to trace provenance and model complex social networks. However, many analytical techniques require the transfer of materials from the museum to the laboratory, involving high insurance costs and limiting the number of items that can be analysed, making the process of empirical data collection a complicated, expensive and time-consuming routine. In this study, we compiled the largest geochemical dataset of Iberian personal adornments (n = 1243 samples) by coupling X-ray fluorescence compositional data with their respective X-ray diffraction mineral labels. This allowed us to develop a machine learning-based framework for the prediction of bead-forming minerals by training and benchmarking 13 of the most widely used supervised algorithms. As a proof of concept, we developed a multiclass model and evaluated its performance on two assemblages from different Portuguese sites with current mineralogical characterisation: Cova das Lapas (n = 15 samples) and Gruta da Marmota (n = 10 samples). Our results showed that decisi{\'o}n-tres based classifiers outperformed other classification logics given the discriminative importance of some chemical elements in determining the mineral phase, which fits particularly well with the decision-making process of this type of model. The comparison of results between the different validation sets and the proof-of-concept has highlighted the risk of using synthetic data to handle imbalance and the main limitation of the framework: its restrictive class system. We conclude that the presented approach can successfully assist in the mineral classification workflow when specific analyses are not available, saving time and allowing a transparent and straightforward assessment of model predictions. Furthermore, we propose a workflow for the interpretation of predictions using the model outputs as compound responses enabling an uncertainty reduction approach currently used by our team. The Python-based framework is packaged in a public repository and includes all the necessary resources for its reusability without the need for any installation.},

  abstract = {In recent years, significant advancements have occurred in our comprehension of amber consumption patterns in the Iberian Peninsula. This progress stems from the increasing volume of FTIR data related to both archaeological and geological amber. Consequently, a chronological model has been established, delineating amber consumption in the Iberian Peninsula from the Late Paleolithic to the Iron Age. Broadly, local amber consumption has been minimal since the Paleolithic period. Sicilian amber makes its appearance in Iberia around the 5th millennium BCE and fades away in the 2nd millennium BCE, giving way to Baltic amber, which has remained the sole source since then. The well-defined chronological model, the abundance of FTIR provenance data, and the infrequent association of amber with absolute or relative dates prompt us to explore whether provenance can serve as a chrono-cultural proxy for amber beads. This study introduces new amber finds, presents fresh FTIR data on archaeological amber ornaments, and incorporates minor updates and bug fixes to the general catalog. It is the outcome of a thorough bibliographic review and on-site analysis and examination of the beads. The results obtained in this study enable the reconstruction of amber consumption throughout Iberian prehistory, drawing on 29 newly FTIR-analyzed ambers from 9 sites. Our findings expand the empirical foundation, facilitating the confirmation of diachronic changes in amber consumption. Importantly, they affirm that amber provenance can indeed be employed as a viable chrono-cultural proxy.},

  abstract = {The discovery of a set of beads, comprising both Sicilian amber and resin-coated beads in the Middle Bronze Age burial site of Cova del Gegant (Sitges, Barcelona, Spain), has sparked inquiries into whether the coating was intended for imitation or counterfeiting of amber. We assert that human-made materials, such as bead coatings, are intentionally conceived, designed, and crafted to fulfill specific functions. Thus, for an object to effectively fulfill its intended purpose, it must meet particular performance criteria influenced by situational factors. This paper aims to construct an empirically grounded narrative elucidating the development and function of resin-coated bead technology. Our methodology includes a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the coating and beads, an exploration of the interplay between technical choices and situational factors, and an investigation into whether the simulation of sensory performance characteristics played a pivotal role in the concept and design of resin-coated beads. Additionally, we synthesize data to unveil broader patterns related to the crafting and utilization of resin-coated and amber beads across time and space. We have documented resin-coated beads in the Iberian Peninsula from the Neolithic period (5th to 3rd millennia BCE) until at least the Middle Bronze Age (first half of the 2nd millennium BCE), where they coexisted with amber beads. Analysis employing ATR-FTIR and {$\mu$}-CT imaging has revealed a composite coating comprising pine resin, beeswax, and carotene, adhered to shell beads with bone glue. This composite material represents the earliest known development in human history, unique to the Iberian Peninsula and without parallel in Prehistoric Europe. Our examination of the performance characteristics and functional roles of resin-coated beads suggests their potential as substitutes for amber beads, particularly in regions where amber was scarce or inaccessible. Despite being crafted from commonplace materials, these coated beads exhibit intentional design choices likely aimed at simulating the visual performance characteristics of amber. This deliberate effort, alongside their widespread distribution across time and space, indicates that composite-coated beads held symbolic and social significance akin to amber beads.},
